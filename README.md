These are OpenGL bindings for [Hare].

[Hare]: https://harelang.org

## Status

The following bindings are currently complete:

* OpenGL 1.0
* OpenGL 1.1
* OpenGL 1.2
* OpenGL 1.3

Binding for extensions and functions through OpenGL 4, will be added
incrementally.

The code has not been fully tested, so please send a patch if you encounter any
problems (e.g. pointer arguments missing `nullable`).
